# Ikigai Labs XYZ ART FRAMES

Build a Farcaster Frame which allows users to mint an NFT if they have liked and recasted a specific cast. Utilizing thirdweb's Engine we can easily make a http request for Engine to execute an on-chain transaction and mint an NFT to the user.


# Thirdweb Engine

Engine is a backend HTTP server that calls smart contracts using your managed backend wallets. Create & manage funded backend wallets to send blockchain transactions via authenticated APIs. Build scalable blockchain apps with transaction retries, wallet nonce management, and gas estimation. Offer the best UX by deploying & transacting with user smart wallets, enabling sign-less flows and gasless transactions. Get a complete web3 infrastructure already set up with RPC, IPFS, and account abstraction infrastructure.
